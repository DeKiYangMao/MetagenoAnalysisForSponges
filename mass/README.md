Use the python compiler to run the script "mass_data_align.py", then enter the mass spectrometry data set and the result folder in the terminal, and run to get the alignment results.
It is worth noting that the last two tables in the ".xls" file of the mass spectrometry dataset must be named "database" and "control".
The "database" table is the database data we want to compare, and the "control" table is the blank control group data in the mass spectrometry detection process.
For the specific data structure, please refer to the uploaded mass spectrometry data set "mass_data.xls".
